Welcome to your second C++ lab!
In this program, let us determine whether an input integer is a perfect square.
If the input is negative, it is invalid.
If the input is non-negative, it may or may not be a perfect square.
If the input is a perfect square, let's find its non-negative integer square root and exit the program.

Please enter an integer number: 789
The input number is not a perfect square.

Please enter an integer number: -500
The input number is invalid.

Please enter an integer number: 0
The input number is a perfect square. Its non-negative integer square root is 0.
The program ends.
